1. Project Overview

The system simulates traffic signal synchronization at multiple intersections.
Its main goal is to minimize congestion and waiting time by dynamically adjusting signal timings based on real-time traffic data.

Key Points:

Modular design ensures scalability.

Uses C programming for simulation.

Simulates real-world traffic scenarios using loops and conditional logic.

2. Modules Breakdown
a) Signal Controller Module

Controls the timing cycles of traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green).

Each signal has configurable time durations.

Handles the switching of signals in sequence for smooth flow.

Example Functionality:

Initialize signal durations

Switch signal after timer expires

Reset cycle after completion

b) Sensor Input Module

Simulates detection of vehicle density at intersections.

Inputs can be predefined or randomized for testing purposes.

Provides data for the Synchronization Engine to adjust timings.

Example Data Points:

Number of vehicles waiting

Arrival rate per lane

Traffic density thresholds

c) Synchronization Engine

Core logic that adjusts signal timings dynamically.

Ensures multiple intersections are synchronized to prevent traffic jams.

Uses traffic density data from Sensor Input Module.

Key Steps:

Read traffic density from sensors

Calculate optimal signal duration

Adjust current signal cycle accordingly

Maintain synchronization across intersections

d) Display Module

Outputs the current status of traffic signals in real time.

Can be displayed as console output or simple text-based interface.

Helps visualize how synchronization affects traffic flow.

Display Example:

Intersection 1: Green | Intersection 2: Red | Intersection 3: Green

3. Workflow / Logic Flow

Start system and initialize all modules

Read sensor inputs for traffic density

Process data in Synchronization Engine

Adjust signals for optimal flow

Display signal status

Repeat continuously

Flow Summary:

START → Read Sensors → Process Data → Adjust Signals → Display → LOOP

4. Benefits of AI-Generated Approach

Provides a clear understanding of each module and its role

Highlights dependencies between modules

Allows quick reference for debugging or extending the project

5. Notes for Implementation

Modular design allows adding more intersections easily

Can be extended to integrate hardware sensors instead of simulated data

Timer-based control ensures smooth and predictable signal switching
